PRC Access

There are a few ways to get RPC access to any node. Assuming that appropriate rpc creds have been set
when deploying the nodes:

1.  Get access via executing comands in the Pod directly. Assuming no custom RPC server is defined -

      kubectl -n bitcoin exec hab-btcd-simnet-0 -- btcctl --rpcuser=user --rpcpass=pass --simnet getinfo

2.  Additionally, you can port forward from the Pod you wish to connect to. Below will map a btcd
    instances default RPC simnet port (18556) to localhost:18556 - you may need to adjust tls settings
    or copy certs -

    Terminal 1:
      kubectl -n bitcoin port-forward hab-btcd-simnet-0 18556:18556
    Terminal 2:
      btcctl --rpcuser=user --rpcpass=pass --simnet getinfo

3.  Lastly, you can access RPC services by setting 'externalAccess.enabled: true' on a node set, defining
    an ingress, adding a certificate (if needed), then copying the btcd generated RPC cert on the pod
    to your local machine, and using it in RPC calls to the exposed service. However, if the replica
    count for the node set is > 1 the loadbalancer will direct traffic all the nodes in the set, where
    only one of the nodes will allow access for that cert. Alternatively, '--notls` options exist on
    various node implementations, but this is less secure, and certainly not recomened for public facing nodes.
